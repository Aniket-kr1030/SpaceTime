# Space Time Simulation

## Overview
Space Time Simulation is an interactive physics simulation that visualizes particle movements and interactions in a simulated space-time environment. Utilizing Python and Pygame, this project allows users to observe the dynamics of particles under various conditions, including gravitational effects and collisions.

## Features
- Real-time simulation of particle movements with adjustable speeds.
- Interactive controls to spawn particles and adjust simulation parameters.
- Visualization of gravitational effects and particle collisions.
- Customizable simulation settings for different experiences.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using pip:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the simulation:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage
- Left-click to spawn a new particle at the mouse location.
- Use the buttons on the right to adjust the simulation speed (x5, x10, x100).
